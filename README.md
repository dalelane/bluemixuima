A UIMA Hello World for BlueMix
==============================

This is a sample for how to do text analytics using Apache UIMA in a BlueMix application.

The "analytics" that the app is doing is trivial, but this is just a Hello World. It's intended to be an example of the config needed to define a UIMA analytics pipeline, wrap it in a REST API, and deploy it as a BlueMix application.

When I get a chance, I'll write a follow-up application that does something more useful.

It's deployed to BlueMix at http://uimahelloworld.mybluemix.net/

It's documented at http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=3073
